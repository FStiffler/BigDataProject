## About this project

For the Part II of our group projects, we evalute a simple research question for a large (>2GB) dataset of our choice. We use the popular [Yelp dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/yelp-dataset/yelp-dataset). This dataset is a subset of Yelp's businesses, reviews, and user data. We implement our analysis in R.

Due to the group size, we take on two seperate analyses: 
* For the first one (insert link to folder/script), we try to estimate the effect of stars assigned on average in reviews on the probability of being a elite user (Uluru OLS).
* The second analysis (insert link to folder/script) tries to predict the most important factors for restaurants to have good reviews (forward selection).

## Getting Started

1. Download the dataset from Kaggle (Version 3).
2. Convert the dataset from json format to csv format using script (insert link to script).
3. Run the data clean up file (link)
